 CAPTCHAs can protect their web services from bots. In addition to visual CAPTCHAs which consist of distorted images,
 mostly test images, that a user must write some description about that image, there are a significant amount of audio CAPTCHAs
 as well. Briefly, audio CAPTCHAs are sound files which consist of human sound under heavy noise where the speaker pronounces 
 a bunch of digits consecu- tively. Generally, in those sound files, there are some periodic and non-periodic noises to get 
 difficult to recognize them with a program but not for a human listener. We gathered numerous randomly collected audio file 
 to train and then test them using our SVM algorithm to be able to extract digits out of each conversation.
